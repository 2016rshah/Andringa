  p <span class="greet">Hello!</span> My name is Peter Andringa, and I'm currently a Senior at <a href='http://tjhsst.edu' target='_blank'>Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a>, an elite high school in Northern Virginia specifically for students who love math, science, engineering, and computer science.
  p I'm really passionate about entrepreneurship, startups, and technology. I've been coding and building cool stuff since 7th grade, and I continue to learn from every project. Right now I'm busy organizing <a href="https://hacktj.org" target="_blank">HackTJ</a>, as well as helping others learn to love entrepreneurship and CS through what we're doing on the <a href="http://gopilot.org" target="_blank">Pilot</a> national team.
